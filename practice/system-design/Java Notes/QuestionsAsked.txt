INTRODUCTION
============
I am Dipesh Parwani 
Working as a “Software Engineer” in Wipro at “Bangalore.
I have a couple of years of experience in Web Application Development using
technologies like Java, JDBC, SQL, Web Services , Spring, Servlets, JSP,Angular Javascript.
My responsibility includes design and development of user interface using Java/J2EE
providing technical support co-workers.

Worked on developing a quoting tool for HPE (NGQ), where
billing and quoting for HPE products and services are being carried out.
RESTController, Service, Repository, DAO. has been the way of the data flow.


===================
TECHNICAL
===================
Q.)HOW TO IMPLEMENT SINGLETON CLASS?(constructor can not be static)
Q.)IMPLEMENT TWO THREADS PRINTING(EVEN & ODD) NUMBERS SEQUENTIALLY?
Q.)BEAN SCOPE IN SPRING
Q.)COLLISION IN HASHMAP
Q.)REVERSE A STRING
Q.)PERMUTATIONS OF STRING
Q.)EXCEPTION HANDLING HEIRARCHY AND IMPLEMENTATION
Q.)REMOVE DUPLICATES FROM A STRING(capital & small letters are same)
Q.)WE MAKE MEMBER VARIABLES PRIVATE TO RESTRICT ACCESS , THEN WHY DOES WE PROVIDE GETTERS/SETTERS

Q.)
class Test{
private Test(){
this.test=test;} 

public static myTest(Test test){
if (test==null){
test=new Test();}
else return test;
}

public static void main(){
Test test = new Test();		//did a blunder here because can not create	
test.myTest();			 an object because the constructor is PRIVATE.

}
}
public class ClassicSingleton {

   private static ClassicSingleton instance = null;    	//create a private,static SELF REFERENCE

   private ClassicSingleton() {
      // Exists only to defeat instantiation.		//mark constructor as PRIVATE
   }

   public static ClassicSingleton getInstance() {	//method returns an object of type CLASS itself
      if(instance == null) {
         instance = new ClassicSingleton();
      }
      return instance;
   }

   public static void main(){
   ClassicSingleton test = ClassicSingleton.getInstance() ;	//method call using ClassName.method();		
   test."any method here";			

   }
}

Q.)n=5
public int compute(int n) {
if (n == -5)
return 1;
return n * compute(n-1);

}






public void DisplayFunct()
{
List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
list.add("Bob");
list.add("Tom");
list.add("Harry");

for (String str : list)
{
str += "InTheTown";
}
System.out.println(list);
}

O/P: BobInTheTown
	TomInTheTown
		HarryInTheTown


Q.)
void myfunction2() {

try {
return;
}
catch(Exception e) {
System.out.println("Inside catch");
}
finally {
System.out.println("Inside final");
}

}

O/P: Inside final




Q.)
public class Test
{
public static void throwit ()
{
System.out.print("throwit ");
throw new Error();
}
public static void main(String [] args)
{
try
{
System.out.print("hello ");
throwit();
}
catch (Exception re )
{
System.out.print("caught ");
}
finally
{
System.out.print("finally ");
}
System.out.println("after ");
}
}


Output:- hello, throwit, finally, 





===================
MANAGERIAL
===================

Tell me about yourself:
As a developer with 2 years of experience, 
where I’ve graduated,
 the companies I’ve been and the projects I’ve worked at. 
I’d state that I’ve always worked in web appplication develpment projects using mainly Java



WHY ARE YOU LEAVING:
ANS.) So the project that I am in right now has no more User Stories coming in and it would eventually come to an end in some time.
	Morover, the work environment at Wipro is steady which inhibits learning in some way. I wish to work in more agressive 
	environment which in turn renders a lot of learning and which uses new age learning tools like JAVA 11.
	

NEXT 5 YEARS:
ANS.)I see myself as an expert in web service development and learn how different systems interact and how the internet works.
     I am also interested in the new age cloud technologies that have come up in recent times and how the tech giants are migrating 
	from offline to the online infrastructure. Basically keep on learning about the Internet and its expansion.
	Morover, I want to learn backend rather than frontend , because it gives you hint of what's going behind the picture.


ACHIEVEMENT AT WORK:	
ANS.)I have helped the new joinees that came through few months ago and imparted what I do and help them learn the stack we 
   work on shared with them resources which I learnt through whenever I was studying , which I think would be the catalyst
	for them to learn.


DISAGREEMENT:
ANS.) Many a times I have been asked by the code reviewer to change certain things in my code even it renders the same result and doesnt impact 
	the fucntionality whatsoever.So i learnt instead of disagreeing and tried to raise concerns in a productive way.
	Yeah, lot of times some defects have come up and I think that's unavoidable.


EXPECTATION IN FIRST 3 MONTHS:
ANS.)WILL understand my role and how does the project work and what all has been done so far , and what is in the future for the project .
	Have my view on how the project could be better.

How would someone else describe you:
They think people would say that they can count on me and come to me to share their problems and get some help.
